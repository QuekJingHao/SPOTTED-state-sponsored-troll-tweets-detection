At worst, if the data is biased, or is unrepresentative from the get go, then all our efforts will be in vain when the biased data is feed into our models. Before we begin, we recognize the limitations in dealing with very large datasets in Pandas. When unzipped, the size of the entire troll dataset archive is **118 Gb**. Furthermore, Pandas is prone to crashing when it reads csv whose size is larger than 3 gb. To go around this, we shall use random sampling to help us obtain a sample that is as representative as possible to the entire population dataset. \n",

However in 2021, they may attack the botched American withdrawal from Afghanistan, by amplifying the number of American casualties.\n",
    "2. Select multiple verified Twitter accounts\n",
    "   - We again should be as representative as possible to cover a large range of topics.\n",
    "3. Ensure there is no data leakage of validation data into training dataset\n",
    "   - We should remove any duplicated tweets if present. We should also randomly shuffle the dataset before we split it into training or validation datasets. In this way, we ensure that the none of the tweets used for validation somehow gets into the training dataset. If this happens, then the performance of the model will be much better than expected.\n",
